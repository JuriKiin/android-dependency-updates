# android-dependency-updates
This Github Action is designed to automatically check for updates in your `libs.versions.toml `file.

If a newer version is found for any library, the action will print this, and optionally open an issue in your repository with the report.

## Inputs

### file-name `String` -`required`

This is the path to the `libs.versions.toml` file that you are running the check against.

### open-issue `Boolean` - `optional`

Whether or not you want an issue to be created if a newer version is found.

### github-token `Secret` - `required`

The github token for your repository.

**Note: This is automatically created by Github and accessed by:**

`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

## Outputs

### dependencies `List<String>`

A list of JSON strings representing the dependencies with outdated versions.
Each item in the list is in the following format:
```
{
    name: String,      // The name of the dependency
    version: String,   // The Current Version
    newVersion: String // The new found version
}

```
